    <h1>IT IS WHAT IT IS BRUH</h1>
    
<p class = border>Ever since i could remember, i have allowed a 
    certain level of <span>bullshit</span> into my life.
    You know, not too much to where im completely lost but just enough to fuck some shit up.</p>

<p><span>But!</span> no matter how hard or atrocious my story is, it isnt an excuse to do nothing! 
And nothing comes for free. Did i really expect to just have things that i didnt work for and thus didnt deserve fall into my lap?! no!<br>
it doesnt work that way... and <span>shame</span> on anyone for thinking otherwise.<br>
i grew up in Los Angeles, California. most of my friends are either dead or in jail.. 
i know how cliche' that sounds but whats even more cliche' is how common that story is.<br>
</p>
<p>
    I remember one Thanksgiving, all the kids were playing in the front yard, when a car drove by and started shooting at my family's house. My little cousin Vick was struck in the head and <span>killed</span>.
    ill never understand why things happend the way they do. why someone so young was not allowed to experience life and all it has to offer.

<h2>...AND IT IS WHAT IT'S GON BE...</h2>

<p class = borderr> Here I am!... this is me!... <span>no one can stop me but me!</span> to keep thinking negative is to continue to bring about negative.
one must be prepared to think different!.. <span>change</span> their thoughts... thats the only way to bring about change.</p>
<p><span>self love</span> is important. self assurance is important... read, learn, pick up new skills!..eat clean, workout. create a program that works for you.
your success cant be predicated on someone elses success. at some point, we have to stand on our own two. i dont say that to validate 
the efforts of those less sensitive to the plight of people who have less. i say this to say; if you sit in shit long enough, you stop smelling it... 
it doesnt stop stinking though... at the end of the day, its up to you.</p>
